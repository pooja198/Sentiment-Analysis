# just a demonstrative accuracy check to observe the difference in target labels obtained after both of the algorithms

#So as per the above analysis there is a trivial difference in the target labels obtained after implementing both of the algorithms 
#i.e. only about 540 records have different value among 25000 records leading to a 97.83 % similarity in results of both the algorithm
