# SVM (Support Vector Machine)

from sklearn.svm import SVC
sv_model = SVC()
sv_model.fit(train_x, train_y)
sv_model_y = sv_model.predict(test_x)

sv_model_accuracy = accuracy_score(test_y, sv_model_y)
sv_model_accuracy   # Thus the SVM model has 76% Accuracy (approx.)



# RFC (Random Forest Classifier)

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
rfc = RandomForestClassifier()
rfc.fit(train_x, train_y)
rfc_y = rfc.predict(test_x)

rfc_accuracy = accuracy_score(test_y, rfc_y)
rfc_accuracy     # Thus the Decision Tree model has 77.26% Accuracy (approx.)

#   Also as deduced in Phase 5 Question 1, We have achieved 85% Accuracy using Naive Baye's Algorithm
#   Hence, for this imdb dataset, the best algorithm which is giving the most accurate result 
#   for this Sentiment Analysis is Naive Baye's Algorithm
